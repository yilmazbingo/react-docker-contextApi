- ec2 allows us to create virtual servers on the cloud, store data on virtual drivers (EBS),distributing load across machines(ELB:load balancing),scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (AKG). when you create an instance, first thing we choose AMI, Amazon Machine Image. use Amazon Linux2 Ami. clink on "Next:Configure Instance Details" and make sure "vpc----" network is created. Then click on launch, you will be prompted to create a key-pair to connect the instance via ssh and run commands on it. go to instance and click "connect". in "SSH" client you will see the commands to execute
  `chmod 400 react-spa.pem`
  `ssh -i "react-spa.pem" ec2-user@ec2-34-229-161-210.compute-1.amazonaws.com` // run this where permission file is

## Install Docker on a Virtual Machine

`sudo yum update -y`
`sudo amazon-linux-extras install docker`
`sudo service docker start`

## Pushing Our local Image to the Cloud

- region is a cluster of data centers. most aws services are region-scoped. you can use a service in a specific region and if you use a same service in another region, you will not have your data. each region can have many availability zones AZ. usually 3 AZ per region, min 2, max 6. Each Az is one or more discrete data centers. All AZ's are separated from each other. they are still connected with high bandwith, ultra-low latency networking. We have connectivity between all available zones. Low latency describes a computer network that is optimized to process a very high volume of data messages with minimal delay (latency.
- Roles are in IAM, we give them to machines. Users is for a physical person, and roles is going to be for a machine. Policies are JSON and defines what Users, Groups, ROles can and cannot do. IAM has a global view. When you create a user, group or a role, it will be across all the regions. IAM has predefined policies. give users the minimal amount of permission -least-privilege-principles. IAM Federation is fo rbig enterprises, they integrate their own repository of users with IAM. Identity Federation uses SAML standard.
- 1 IAM role per app. each app has its own lifecycle.
- add user with programmatic access and aws management console. i set autogenerated password and can send it to the user, so user can chage it upon login. Next, choose attach existing policies directly, and i will give myself admin access. Also in this step use default "create user without a permissions boundary". after creating the user, download the security credentials. create "admins" group and add "yilmaz". if you go to users/permissions you see there are two permissions are attached to user "yilmaz". since they are managable I delete them. In Account settings you can change the password policy.
